# Birdsense — architecture notes

Birdsense is the Eastside Audubon web app for bird-call detections (BirdNET)
from local listening stations. One Go binary serves the JSON API *and* the
static frontend, so the whole app is one container with no reverse proxy, no
Node runtime, and no separate deploy for the UI.

What it stores is documented in [SCHEMA.md](SCHEMA.md); the Azure resources it
runs on (and the source for Terraform) are in [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md),
and going back to an earlier image is [ROLLBACK.md](ROLLBACK.md).

## Decisions

**Vanilla JS + web components, no framework.** Components are native custom
elements with shadow DOM. The app is small, its lifetime is long, and browser
APIs don't need migrating every two years. Practical consequence: there is no
virtual DOM, so a component re-renders by rewriting its own shadow root.

**No build step.** `frontend/` is served byte-for-byte as written, using native
ES modules (`<script type="module">`). No bundler, no transpiler, no
`node_modules`, no `npm install` before you can see a change. This is the
constraint that pays for itself in the Dockerfile and in onboarding — it holds
until the frontend actually needs a third-party package. (This is a frontend
rule only; Go dependencies are a separate call, see *Go dependencies* below.)
*Revisit when:* we need an npm dependency, or asset fingerprinting for
long-lived caching. Then add one build stage to the Dockerfile and bump the
`max-age` in `internal/web`; don't reach for a framework at the same time.
A few things are not served from this repo, and each degrades rather than
breaks in a container with no outbound network:
- The mono webfont (IBM Plex Mono), linked from Google Fonts in `index.html`.
  Text is Helvetica Neue/Arial, the main site's own stack, so it needs no
  download; every rule names a real fallback.
- Leaflet, for the recorders map. It comes from jsDelivr through the import map
  in `index.html` (pinned version and SRI hash); its CSS is linked inside
  `<bs-station-map>`'s shadow root, so bump both together. The component
  `import()`s it lazily, so if the CDN is unreachable the map shows a note and
  the coordinate fields still work. A third-party frontend module that is
  loaded this way doesn't trigger *Revisit when* below; one that needs npm does.
- tus-js-client, for card uploads. It comes from jsDelivr as its browser build
  (a classic script that defines `window.tus`), pinned with an SRI hash in
  `js/upload-flow.js`, which injects it when an upload starts. It can't use the
  import map: the package's ES modules import CommonJS dependencies, and
  jsDelivr's generated `+esm` bundles can't carry an SRI hash. This one doesn't
  degrade: without jsDelivr a card can't be sent, and the upload page says the
  uploader didn't load.
- Map tiles, from OpenStreetMap's public tile servers. Their usage policy wants
  the attribution kept visible and light traffic; move to a paid provider or
  our own tiles before putting a map on the public landing page.
Self-host any of these if that trade stops being worth it.

**Response headers are set once, for everything.** `web.SecurityHeaders` wraps
the whole mux -- API and frontend alike -- with a content security policy and
the smaller headers (`nosniff`, `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, `Referrer-Policy`,
COOP, CORP, `Permissions-Policy`). HSTS follows the same "not in dev" rule the
session cookie's `Secure` flag does. The policy is `default-src 'none'` plus
one directive per thing the frontend actually loads, so the third-party origins
listed under *No build step* are named in one place in Go and a new one is a
one-line diff that says what capability it bought. Two allowances are
deliberate:
- `style-src` keeps `'unsafe-inline'`. Every component writes a `<style>` into
  its own shadow root and several set a `style` attribute, and with no build
  step there is nothing to hash them with. (Adopted stylesheets aren't subject
  to CSP; a shadow root's own `<style>` is.)
- `script-src` names exactly one inline script, `index.html`'s import map, by
  hash. Gotcha: it is hashed out of the file at startup rather than written
  down as a constant, because nothing keeps a constant in step with a file that
  has no build step -- and a blocked import map fails *silently*, so the
  mistake would surface only as the recorders map quietly not loading. An
  external import map would avoid the whole problem, but no browser supports
  one. `internal/web`'s test checks the shipped `index.html` has nothing else
  inline.
*Revisit when:* the frontend gains a build step -- then the component styles
can be hashed or nonced too -- or something has to embed a Birdsense page or
clip cross-origin, which `frame-ancestors` and CORP currently refuse.

**Go backend, static content included.** `internal/web` mounts the frontend at
`/` as the catch-all; `internal/api` claims `/api/v1/`. Unmatched paths under
`/api/` return a JSON 404 rather than index.html, so a mistyped API path looks
like an API error instead of silently returning HTML.

Gotcha: the static handler registers `"/"`, not `"GET /"`. A method-restricted
root pattern conflicts with `"/api/"` and `http.ServeMux` *panics at startup* —
which no package-level test catches, so `cmd/server/main_test.go` wires the real
mux and asserts the routes coexist.

**Static files from disk, not `go:embed`.** The static directory is a runtime
setting (`BIRDSENSE_STATIC_DIR`), so editing a file in `frontend/` and hitting
reload shows the change without recompiling Go. The container gets
self-containment from `COPY frontend/`, not from embedding.
*Revisit when:* we want a single distributable binary outside Docker.

**The API is the same shape the real one will be.** Routes, methods and JSON
shapes are settled; only what is behind them is temporary (see *State of the
code*). Public data is separated from everything else at the route level, so the
landing page never needs a session:

```
GET    /api/v1/health                     liveness: always ok, and where analysis stands
GET    /api/v1/ready                      readiness: 503 when this replica can't reach the database or storage
GET    /api/v1/public/overview?days=      program stats + confirmed species
GET    DELETE /api/v1/session             who you are; sign out
GET    /api/v1/auth/{provider}/start      leave for Google or Microsoft
GET    /api/v1/auth/{provider}/callback   come back from them, signed in
GET    /api/v1/stations                   recorders in the field
GET    POST /api/v1/uploads               your cards; register a card and its files
GET    /api/v1/uploads/{reference}       one of your cards, with its files and their status
POST   /api/v1/uploads/{reference}/progress   the transfer is running or stopped
POST   HEAD PATCH /api/v1/tus/{id}        card audio: one tus upload per file
GET    /api/v1/detections                 every card's detections: a window of them, filtered, sorted, a page at a time (one model's: ?model=perch)
GET    /api/v1/detections/{reference}?file=        a page of what was heard on a card, or in one of its files (?model= too)
GET    /api/v1/detections/{reference}/{id}         one detection, with its card and file
GET    /api/v1/detections/{reference}/{id}/clip    its clip, as a WAV
PUT    /api/v1/detections/{reference}/{id}/review  confirm, discard, or undo
GET    /api/v1/admin/uploads              every card, admin only
GET    DELETE /api/v1/admin/uploads/{reference}  one card, with every file and its status; delete it
GET    POST /api/v1/admin/people          the roster
PUT    DELETE /api/v1/admin/people/{id}   edit or remove someone
POST   /api/v1/admin/stations
PUT    DELETE /api/v1/admin/stations/{id} rename, move or remove a recorder
GET    /api/v1/dev/people                 the roster, dev mode only
POST   /api/v1/session                    sign in as anyone on it, dev mode only
```

Dev mode follows `BIRDSENSE_DB=local` (Azure runs Cosmos, so it can't be on
there). It registers the `/dev/*` routes *and* `POST /session`, and
`GET /session` reports it as `dev`, so the sign-in page offers a picker of
everyone on the roster. A deployed server registers neither, so its only way in
is a provider.

A card belongs to a volunteer: `/uploads/{ref}` and its tus uploads 404 for
anyone else, and the `/admin/*` routes 403 for a volunteer.
Detections are not a card's: anyone signed in hears and reviews every card's,
under `/detections`. A card's counts are
the server's own tally of the files it has received (`tallyFiles`), never
reported by the client, so a retried chunk can't count twice, and a card moves
to `processing` only once every file on its list is in. The roster always keeps an admin: removing or
demoting the last one is a 409, and so is an admin removing themselves.

**A list of detections is bounded twice: by a window, and by a ceiling.** A
recorder yields on the order of 4,000 detections a day, the Cosmos SDK can't
page or sort a cross-partition query (SCHEMA.md), and every row that matches is
therefore decoded into the memory of the one replica that is also running
BirdNET -- which has 2 GiB for that, BirdNET and tusd's buffers together. So:
- `GET /detections` answers for the last **week** when the request names no
  `since`, and says which window in `window`, which the Detections tab prints
  above the list. The tab opens on the same week, with those dates filled into
  its date fields, so what bounds the list is on the screen and a reviewer can
  widen it; the server's window is what a request that names no dates at all
  still gets.
- `db.MaxDetectionScan` is the ceiling under the window: a filter matching more
  detections than that is `db.ErrTooMany`, which the API answers as a 400
  naming the filters that would narrow it. Measured, a decoded detection costs
  ~900 bytes of live heap, so the ceiling is a few hundred MB and an unbounded
  read is not -- three months of a five-recorder program measured 1.67 GiB,
  which is the replica. A window keeps the ordinary request cheap; the ceiling
  is what makes a careless one a message instead of a restart.

`GET /detections/{ref}` takes the same `limit` and `offset` and reports `total`
beside the page. `js/detection-list.js` is the browser's side of this: it reads
the tab's filters and sort off the query string, asks for a page, and *holds*
the few pages it has fetched. That is what lets a detection opened from the
list have Previous and Next step through the list -- in its order, across
cards, and on into the next page when a reviewer reaches the end of one --
without re-running the search on every step. A detection opened from anywhere
else (a card, a link that carries no list) steps through its file instead.
Neither is a nicety: it is the same read, and holding the page is what keeps a
reviewer from re-running it on every step. A page's station names are point
reads of the cards on that page, for the same reason.
*Revisit when:* a reviewer meets the ceiling in ordinary work rather than by
widening the dates -- more recorders will do it, and so will a whole season on
one screen or a species tally that has to count what the window leaves out.
Then the answer is a precomputed summary document and a query the database
pages itself, not a wider window and a higher ceiling.

**The landing page is answered a minute at a time.** `GET /public/overview`
needs no session, and answering it reads every recorder, every card and every
confirmed detection of the year, aggregating in Go because Cosmos can't
aggregate across partitions (SCHEMA.md). That is the most expensive read in the
app, on the one replica that is also running BirdNET, on the one route anyone
on the internet can ask for. So `overviewCache` holds each window's answer for
the minute it is stamped with, and admits one scan at a time, so an anonymous
flood costs one scan a minute per window size rather than one scan each; the
response carries `Cache-Control: public` for what is left of that minute.
Nothing about the answer changes -- `updatedAt` is already that minute, so a
cached answer is the one a fresh scan would have given. The cost is that
confirming a detection can take up to a minute to show on the landing page. It
is in the process, not a cache service, because one replica is the whole
deployment (DEPLOYMENT.md).
*Revisit when:* the app runs more than one replica, or the scan is slow enough
that a minute's worth of it still hurts. Then it is the same precomputed
summary document the detections list would want, written when a review is
confirmed.

**Routes are paths, not hashes.** `/`, `/signin`, the tabs everyone signed in
has (`/app/upload` and its steps, such as `/app/upload/check`; `/app/uploads`;
`/app/detections`), the three a coordinator has as well (`/admin/uploads`,
`/admin/recorders`, `/admin/people`), a card (`/admin/uploads/{reference}`) and
a detection opened from it
(`/admin/uploads/{reference}/detections/{id}`), and one opened from the
detections list, `/app/detections/{reference}/{id}`. A page
may keep its view in the query string (`/app/detections?species=Strix+varia`):
the router carries it through links, `replaceQuery` rewrites it without a
history entry, and the detection page carries the list's back with it.
`internal/web` already falls back to index.html for
extension-less paths, so a reload mid-wizard lands on the same screen, and a
coordinator can send a colleague a link to one admin tab. `js/router.js` is the
whole router; `<bs-app>` holds the route table (exact paths, plus `prefix`
routes for a path with an id on the end) and the two guards (signed in,
and admin for `/admin/*`). Guards are convenience only -- the API enforces the
same rules, so guessing a path gets you a 401 or 403, not data.
A route may `redirect` instead of naming a page, as a path or as a function of
the path; the detections tab was two tabs once, so `/admin/detections` and
`/admin/detections/{reference}/{id}` redirect to the `/app` ones, filters and
all.
A route also carries its `title`, and `<bs-app>` does for a route change what
the browser does for itself on a full load: names the page, goes to the top of
it, and moves the focus into the region it just drew, so the next Tab is on the
new page. Only a change of *path* counts -- a page rewriting its own filters
into the query string is the same page. `scrollRestoration` is `manual` for the
same reason the title is set here: a page fetches before it can draw, so a
restored offset lands against the wrong height. Gotcha: a path with a malformed
percent-escape (`/admin/uploads/%zz`) matches no route and gets the 404 screen,
because every page under a prefix route decodes the id off the end and
`decodeURIComponent` throws -- which, out of `render()`, is a blank page.

**Sign-in is OpenID Connect; the roster is the allow-list.** `internal/api/auth.go`
runs the authorization-code flow (PKCE, state and nonce in one short-lived
signed cookie) against Microsoft, and Google when a second client id is set.
Verifying the ID token is a real job, so it uses `github.com/coreos/go-oidc`
rather than parsing JWTs by hand. What a provider proves is *which address you
own*; what lets you in is a coordinator having put that address on the roster,
which is why the sign-in audience can safely be "any Microsoft account,
personal ones included" and volunteers use whatever address they already have.
Two consequences worth knowing:
- Accepting any Microsoft account means accepting any organization's
  directory, and a directory's administrators choose what their users' `email`
  claims say. So an email claim is only believed when the provider is in a
  position to know it: a personal account (`tid` is the consumer tenant), an
  organization that has proved it owns the domain (`xms_edov`, an optional
  claim the app registration has to ask for), or Google's `email_verified`.
  Anything else is refused with `unverified-email`. `trustedEmail` is the
  whole rule.
- Microsoft's multi-tenant endpoints report a *templated* issuer, which
  go-oidc refuses, so discovery passes `InsecureIssuerURLContext` and the
  issuer is checked per token against the token's own `tid` (`verifyIssuer`).
The session cookie is the address, HMAC-signed with `BIRDSENSE_SESSION_KEY`
(`cookies.go`); the key is configuration, not generated at startup, so a new
revision doesn't sign everyone out -- and rotating it deliberately is how you
end every session at once. Because that cookie *is* the identity, a guessable
key mints an admin session, and hashing the passphrase to 32 bytes fixes its
length but not its strength: a deployment's key must be at least
`api.MinSessionKeyLen` bytes, checked where the environment is read
(`cmd/server`) and again at plan time in `infra/variables.tf`. `newKeyset`
itself only refuses an empty key, so tests can sign with a short one. Removing someone from the roster already ends
theirs, so there is no session store to revoke from.
The browser finds out the same way it finds out anything: `api.js` turns any
401 into a sign-out in `session.js`, so one ended session bounces the app to
the sign-in page (`/signin?error=session-ended`) instead of leaving every
screen reporting "sign in first" under a header that still has your name in
it. That is the only re-check there is -- `session.load()` runs once, at
startup -- so a page that makes no API call won't notice.
*Revisit when:* a provider has to be something other than Google or Microsoft,
or sessions need to be listed and revoked one at a time.

**Card audio goes over tus, through the app.** A card is ~128 GB in files of a
few hundred MB, sent over home connections that drop. The browser sends each
file as its own tus upload (tus-js-client) to `/api/v1/tus/`, where tusd, used
as a Go library rather than its standalone server, writes it through
`internal/storage`: a directory in dev, block blobs in Azure. A dropped or
paused file resumes from the last chunk the server has. Birdsense's rules live
in tusd's hooks (`internal/api/tus.go`). A file can only be created if it is on
the list its card was registered with, at that size, and not already in. When
its last byte lands, its `audioFiles` document is marked `uploaded` and the card
recounted, before the browser is told it succeeded. Files go one at a time, in
50 MB chunks, so each request fits the Container Apps ingress timeout.
Going through the app rather than straight to Blob Storage with SAS URLs keeps
one upload path for dev and prod and the card rules in Go, at the cost of every
byte passing through the container.
Gotchas: tusd's locks are in memory, so every request for an upload has to
reach the same process -- one replica (see DEPLOYMENT.md). And tusd's
`Config.Logger` is a `golang.org/x/exp/slog` logger, not `log/slog`, so tusd
writes its own warnings to stdout.
*Revisit when:* the app needs more than one replica, or the container's share
of a card upload (CPU, bandwidth) costs more than direct-to-blob uploads would.

**A file's length is the whole integrity check.** A file may only be sent if it
is on the list its card was registered with, at that length, and a tus upload
isn't complete until its last byte lands -- so a truncated or mis-stitched file
can never be marked `uploaded`, and TLS covers the wire. There is no checksum,
and no `sha256` field. A checksum is only worth having if it is verified before
the volunteer is told the card is safe to erase, and every cheap place to verify
it is after that moment: Web Crypto has no streaming digest, so the browser
would have to read all ~128 GB a second time, and the server would have to carry
a running hash across a file's PATCHes and read the blob back to resume one.
What length doesn't catch is a byte flipped in place by a failing reader or bad
memory, which BirdNET then reports as a file it can't read.
A length is the volunteer's word, so it is bounded: `cardList` refuses a file
over 32 GiB, or a card over 1 TiB or 50,000 files, and tusd's `MaxSize` is that
same per-file bound for a length that was never on a card's list. The numbers
leave room for a larger card than anyone runs; what they are there for is that
a card is registered before a byte is sent, and every declared size is summed
into an `int64` -- unbounded, a crafted list overflows those sums and registers
a card whose `totalBytes` is negative.
*Revisit when:* a real card yields files BirdNET can't read and we can't tell a
corrupt transfer from a corrupt card. Then hash in the browser and verify in
tusd's finish hook, before the file counts as received -- not at analysis time,
which is a day after the card was erased.

**Terraform owns what is deployed.** `infra/` is the whole Azure stack and
`scripts/deploy.ps1` is the whole deploy: build this commit in ACR, then
`terraform apply -var image_tag=<sha>`. One owner for the running image means a
rollback is applying an older tag (ROLLBACK.md) and `terraform plan` is never
wrong about the app, at the cost of needing Terraform credentials to deploy. So nothing runs
`az containerapp update` -- that is drift the next apply reverts.
*Revisit when:* deploys move to CI, which should get an identity that can push
images and update the app but not touch state; that is the point of
`ignore_changes` on the image (DEPLOYMENT.md, *Deploying a new version*).

**One set of tabs, and the admin ones are hidden.** A coordinator is a
volunteer with three more tabs, not a second application:
`<bs-app-page>` is the shell for everyone signed in, and its tab table marks
three entries `admin`, which `session.isAdmin()` filters out. So a coordinator
uploads a card, resumes their own, and reviews detections on the same screens a
volunteer does, and a screen only has to be built and kept working once. The
admin tabs keep their `/admin/` paths, because that is what the route guard
reads and what makes an admin-only page obvious in a link. The shell's greeting
is a salutation, not a heading: the one `<h1>` on every one of these routes is
the page's own, so a reader moving by headings lands on what they came for.
*Revisit when:* the roster grows a third role, or a coordinator's version of a
shared screen has to differ by more than what it lists.

**Shared stylesheets live in a cascade layer.** `shared-styles.js` exports
`CSSStyleSheet` objects for the primitives that appear on nearly every screen
(buttons, tables, form fields, panels, the row of filter pills above a list); a
component adopts what it needs via `static styles`, and `reset` -- box-sizing,
`[hidden]`, `.visually-hidden` -- is adopted by `BaseElement` itself, because a
document stylesheet doesn't reach into a shadow root. Gotcha: `adoptedStyleSheets` are ordered *after* a shadow
root's own `<style>`, so an unlayered shared rule silently beats the component
that adopted it. Every shared sheet is therefore wrapped in
`@layer bs-base { ... }`, because unlayered rules outrank every layer -- what a
component writes for itself always wins.
`reset` is also where the keyboard focus ring lives, for the same reason
`box-sizing` does: `outline` isn't inherited, so `app.css`'s rule reaches
nothing inside a shadow root and every button in the app would fall back to the
UA ring, which is what the tokens are there to replace. The two copies are kept
in step by hand.
Gotcha: `reset`'s `.visually-hidden` pins `top: 0; left: 0`, which the usual
sr-only recipe doesn't. Without it the box sits at its static position but
against the *page*, since it rarely has a positioned ancestor -- so a column
label inside a scrolled table escapes the scroller and drags the whole document
sideways, on a phone, with nothing to see there.

**Go dependencies are fine; the stdlib already covers HTTP.** The "no
dependencies" rule is about the *frontend* (npm packages, see *No build step*).
It does not apply to the Go module. Add a Go dependency when it does a real job
the standard library doesn't: a database driver, migrations, password hashing
(`golang.org/x/crypto`), BirdNET/audio parsing, and so on. A Go dependency costs
one `go get` plus the cached `go mod download` layer already in the Dockerfile.
Routing and logging are already covered: `net/http` with Go 1.22+
method-and-path patterns (`"GET /api/v1/health"`) handles routes, and
`log/slog` handles logs. So we don't add a router, web framework, or logging
library just out of habit.

**Dependencies are scanned, and the toolchain is pinned.** `govulncheck` is
part of the checks above, and `.github/workflows/checks.yml` runs all of them
on every push and pull request *and* once a week, because an advisory lands
against code nobody has touched -- a scan that only runs on push would never
hear about it. It reports what the code can reach, not what is merely in the
dependency graph, so the answer to an advisory in a module nothing calls is
usually to leave it. The Go toolchain is a dependency like any other: the
`toolchain` line in `backend/go.mod` names the exact patch release, which is
what CI installs (`go-version-file`) and the minimum the Dockerfile's
`golang:` image must carry, so a standard-library advisory is fixed by a
one-line bump that shows up in review rather than by whichever Go a build
agent happened to have. Bump it with `go get toolchain@goX.Y.Z`, and keep the
Dockerfile's image tag in step.
*Revisit when:* deploys move to CI -- then the same workflow can build and push
the image, and the weekly run is the natural place to also rebuild it.

**One Store, two backends.** `internal/db` defines a `Store` interface with an
entity-specific method per read or write the API needs (`ListUploads`,
`UpdateDetection`, ...) and two implementations: Cosmos DB for NoSQL in Azure,
and a single JSON file for local development. `BIRDSENSE_DB` picks one, and
defaults to `cosmos` so a misconfigured deployment fails at startup instead of
quietly writing to a file. Named methods rather than a query builder, because
both backends must give identical answers, and filtering and sorting live once
in `db.go`. Gotcha: the Go Cosmos SDK only runs cross-partition queries the
gateway can serve, so queries are `SELECT * ... WHERE` and anything like
`ORDER BY`, `COUNT` or `DISTINCT` happens in Go (details in SCHEMA.md). Updates
take a mutate func (read, change, replace-if-unchanged), which is where rules
like "progress only moves forward" become race-free.
*Revisit when:* the JSON file gets slow (it rewrites everything on each write) —
that means dev data has outgrown it, not that it needs indexing.

**BirdNET runs as a Python subprocess.** BirdNET's maintained runtime is the
`birdnet` Python package, so `internal/birdnet` runs `analyzer/analyze.py`
with a batch of files and parses the one JSON object it prints, rather than
binding a TFLite runtime into Go through cgo. Clips are cut the same way, by
`analyzer/clip.py` with soundfile, which is what birdnet reads audio with, so a
file BirdNET could analyze can be cut. The model loads once per batch, so
hand it a night of files, not one at a time. The package uses BirdNET v2.4 on
LiteRT (`library="litert"`), which needs no TensorFlow. Two consequences:
- The runtime image is Debian (`python:3.12-slim-bookworm`), not Alpine,
  because the LiteRT and numpy wheels are glibc builds. The venv and the models
  (~90 MB, acoustic plus the geo model for location filtering) are baked in at
  build time, so analysis never needs the network. The image is now several
  hundred MB rather than ~20.
- Each inference worker is its own process with its own model copy (~285 MB
  peak for the whole tree with one worker). Cancelling the context kills the
  process group, so workers don't outlive a cancelled run.
**The analysis queue is the database.** `internal/analysis` runs in the server
process. A card in `processing` with files in `uploaded` status is queued work;
there is no separate queue to keep in step with the documents, and nothing in
memory to lose. `Queue.Run` takes one file at a time, oldest card first: it
copies the file out of `internal/storage` to a temp file (keeping its
extension, which birdnet picks a decoder by), runs BirdNET with the recorder's
position and week, merges each species' consecutive windows into one detection
at the highest confidence (`merge.go`), cuts a clip of each with `clip.py` (the
run and 1 s either side, at most 30 s around its best window) into storage at
`clips/{card}/{detection}.flac`, upserts the detections, marks the file
`analyzed`, and recounts the card. The API only calls `Enqueue` to wake it when a card's last
file lands. At startup it resumes whatever was left, including a file cut off
mid-run (`analyzing`); detection ids are deterministic, so a re-run overwrites.
A file BirdNET can't read fails at once; any other failure on a file -- a
crashed run of either script, or storing its clips, its detections or its
result -- is retried twice, 30 s apart and growing, and then fails the file, so
nothing that keeps failing can wedge the queue. The last file moves the card to
`in_review`, or `needs_attention` if any failed.
One file per run, not a night per run: measured on the Osprey clip, a warm run
spends ~3 s starting Python and loading the model, and BirdNET takes ~18 s per
10 minutes of audio. On hour-long card files that overhead is ~3%, and in
exchange each file's detections are stored as soon as it's done and only one
file sits in temp storage at a time.
*Revisit when:* analysis moves to its own Container Apps job (see
DEPLOYMENT.md). Then the web image can go back to Alpine and this stage moves to
the job's image, and `Queue.Run` is what the job runs.

**Perch is a second opinion, run as a step of its own.** With
`BIRDSENSE_PERCH` on, Google's Perch v2 runs over every file after BirdNET,
through the same `analyze.py` (`--model perch`) and the same merge, clip and
upsert path in `Queue.run`, and its detections are stored beside BirdNET's with
`model: "perch"`. It is a second opinion, not a replacement and not a merge:
the two models' detections of one bird are two documents
(`db.ModelDetectionID` adds the model to Perch's ids and leaves BirdNET's as
they were), every list is one model's at a time (`?model=`, BirdNET's by
default), and the public page counts BirdNET's alone, because a bird both
heard would otherwise count twice. It is an internal detail, not a choice
anyone makes: the Detections tab never asks for Perch's, and only a
coordinator's card page (`<bs-admin-upload-detail>`) shows them, under
BirdNET's. Three consequences:
- **Its step is separate from the file's.** `audioFiles.perch` has its own
  status, attempts and failure, so Perch failing on a file leaves BirdNET's
  result and doesn't put the card in `needs_attention`. A file waiting for
  Perch still holds its card in `processing`, which is what keeps retention off
  its audio until Perch has read it.
- **BirdNET never waits for it.** `drain` catches BirdNET up on every card, then
  takes one Perch file, then looks again -- Perch is ~3x BirdNET's time, and a
  new card's first opinion shouldn't queue behind an old card's second.
- **Its scores are a softmax, not a sigmoid.** Perch's outputs are logits, and
  a sigmoid over them puts nearly every top-five guess at 0.99+, so a threshold
  would keep everything. A softmax over the window's classes put the test
  Osprey at 0.33-0.91 and anything else at 0.05 or less, so the card's one
  `minConfidence` means something for both. The two scales still aren't
  comparable, which is one more reason the lists stay apart. Perch's labels are
  scientific names only; common names are borrowed from BirdNET's labels, and
  the geo model's species list is matched to Perch's by scientific name.
It costs TensorFlow in the image (~1.3 GB, always installed, so it is a
setting rather than a build) and ~2.5 GB of peak memory, which is why it is
off by default and why Terraform refuses it on less than 4Gi (DEPLOYMENT.md,
*Perch*).
*Revisit when:* Perch's detections turn out to be worth publishing. Then the
public page needs a rule for a bird both models heard -- one detection per
species per window, say -- not a second count.

**A stuck card says why.** Whether BirdNET can run at all is the queue's own
business, not the server's: `Queue.Run` won't start until `Check` passes and
keeps checking on a growing delay (30 s to 10 minutes), so a server whose
Python can't `import birdnet` warns for as long as that is true instead of
once at startup, and an environment put right underneath it is picked up
without a restart. Cards wait in `processing` meanwhile rather than failing.
What it is waiting for, or what a pass last stopped on, is `Queue.Status`,
which the API serves as `queue` on `/health` (the bare state -- that route has
no session) and on the two coordinator routes that list cards
(`GET /admin/uploads`, `GET /admin/uploads/{ref}`), where `<bs-queue-note>`
puts it above the cards it explains. The volunteer's own list doesn't carry it:
the detail names server-side paths, and nothing on it is theirs to act on.
*Revisit when:* something other than this process analyzes cards -- then the
state is no longer one server's to report, and belongs in a document.

**Liveness and readiness are different questions.** `/api/v1/health` answers
200 whatever is happening; `/api/v1/ready` pings the database and the file
store (`Store.Ping` on both, the cheapest call that would still fail if the
credential or the network had gone) and 503s when either is unreachable.
Container Apps restarts a replica that fails liveness and takes one that fails
readiness out of ingress, and only the second is ever right here: there is one
replica, it is the one analyzing a card, and restarting it neither fixes Cosmos
nor brings the run back. Readiness says nothing about the analysis queue for
the same reason -- that is `health`'s to report (above), and a queue that can't
start leaves the site perfectly able to serve. The probe numbers in
`infra/app.tf` are set explicitly for the same reason the split exists: the
provider's defaults assume a container that isn't CPU-saturated by BirdNET for
hours.
*Revisit when:* analysis moves to its own job -- then no health response is
ever queued behind a BirdNET run, and tighter probes are reasonable again.

**Clips are FLAC.** `clip.py` writes each clip as mono 16-bit FLAC at the
source's sample rate. It is lossless, so a clip is still exactly what BirdNET
heard, and on the test Osprey recording it is 38% of the same WAV -- a field
recorder's noise floor rarely uses all 16 bits, which is what FLAC exploits.
That is worth having because clips are the one thing here that only
accumulates: originals expire a month on (below), clips are kept until someone
deletes the card. Every browser the app supports has played FLAC since 2019 and
`decodeAudioData` takes it too, which is the part `<bs-spectrogram>` needs.
Gotcha: clips cut before this are still WAV, under the names their detections
carry, and nothing backfills them. So `ClipName` says what a clip written *now*
is called and nothing may read a format off a stored one: `getClip` takes the
content type from `clip.blobName`, the component takes the blob type from the
response, and `clipRate` reads the sample rate out of either header -- it
decodes at the clip's own rate, so a 24 kHz recording isn't drawn over an empty
top half. Re-analysis replaces a clip by name, so a re-run of a file analyzed
before FLAC leaves its old `.wav` behind; deleting the card sweeps the prefix.
*Revisit when:* clips have to be small rather than exact. Then it is Opus, and
the spectrogram wants drawing from something other than the archive copy.

**Originals expire; clips don't.** A recorder yields ~5.5 GB of audio a day
against ~0.7 GB of clips, and nothing reads an original once BirdNET has:
`internal/analysis` is the only reader of `uploads/`, and the only audio a
browser ever plays is a clip. So `internal/retention` sweeps every few hours in
the server process and deletes a card's recordings a month after it was
received, while its detections and their clips are kept until someone deletes
the card. `BIRDSENSE_AUDIO_RETENTION_DAYS` sets the window; `0` keeps
everything. The sweep only looks at cards BirdNET has finished with
(`in_review`, `needs_attention`, `results_sent`) and, on them, only at files in
`analyzed` or `failed` status: a card stuck in `processing` keeps its audio
however old it is, so the policy can't take a recording the queue is still
waiting to read. The blob goes before the document is marked, because a sweep
interrupted in between leaves something the next sweep finishes, whereas the
other order leaks a blob nothing names. Doing it in Go rather than with an
Azure lifecycle rule keeps dev and prod the same, lets the rule see whether a
file has been analyzed, and keeps `blobName` honest; the lifecycle rule stays
as a backstop for abandoned partial uploads, which have no document at all.
The cost of the policy is that a card can't be re-analyzed once its window
passes -- a better model, or a lower threshold, only ever runs against cards
still inside it.
*Revisit when:* a card has to be held past its window (a hold flag on the
upload, which the sweep would skip), or re-analysis matters more than the bill.

**Spectrograms are drawn in the browser.** `<bs-spectrogram>` fetches a
detection's clip once, plays it from a blob URL, decodes it with Web Audio and
runs its own FFT onto a canvas, in the paper and ink tokens. The clip is the
only thing stored, and there is no image library or frontend package.
*Revisit when:* a spectrogram has to appear without JavaScript (an email), or
another page needs the same picture of a whole file.

**Design tokens in CSS custom properties.** Custom properties pierce shadow DOM
boundaries, so `styles/app.css` defines `--bs-*` tokens and every component
styles itself with `var(--bs-*)`. That is the *only* styling channel across the
shadow boundary — components never hard-code colors or spacing, and page CSS
never reaches into a component.

## Conventions

- Custom elements are prefixed `bs-`, one per file, filename matching the tag
  (`bs-detection-card.js`). The class name is the CamelCase form; the tag is
  what everything else refers to.
- Components extend `BaseElement` (`js/components/base-element.js`): open shadow
  root, `render()` builds the whole subtree, observed attribute changes
  re-render. Extend `HTMLElement` directly if a component needs finer-grained
  updates — the base class is a convenience, not a framework. Two components
  that are the same screen twice extend a base class of their own instead of
  copying it: `uploads-table.js` is `<bs-my-uploads>` and `<bs-admin-uploads>`,
  which differ only in their columns, their last one's action and their
  wording.
- Rich data is passed as a **property** (`card.detection = {...}`); attributes
  are for simple strings/flags.
- Anything interpolated into an `innerHTML` template — API data, attribute
  values — goes through `escapeHTML()`.
- API responses are JSON objects, never bare arrays (`{"detections": [...]}`),
  so a response can grow fields without breaking clients.
- Go: handlers stay in `internal/api`, `internal/*` packages do not import
  `cmd/`. Tests sit beside the code (`api_test.go`).
- A stored field changes in `internal/db/models.go` and SCHEMA.md together;
  a container or partition key change also updates DEPLOYMENT.md.

## Running it

Dev (two concerns, one process — Go serves the frontend from disk):

```sh
cd backend && BIRDSENSE_DB=local go run ./cmd/server     # http://localhost:8080
```

Frontend edits need only a browser reload; Go edits need a restart.
`BIRDSENSE_DB=local` stores data in `backend/data/birdsense.json` (git-ignored,
override with `BIRDSENSE_LOCAL_DB_PATH`), and uploaded audio under
`backend/data/audio` (`BIRDSENSE_STORAGE_DIR`), at the names it would have in
Blob Storage. There is no sample card: to try an upload, point the folder
picker at any folder with a few `.wav` files in it. When that file is empty, startup fills
it with the placeholder program from `internal/devseed`: people to sign in as
and recorders. It seeds no cards or detections, so the card lists and the landing
page stay empty until you upload a card and BirdNET runs over it. Delete the file
to re-seed. Without
`BIRDSENSE_DB=local` the server expects Cosmos DB (`BIRDSENSE_COSMOS_ENDPOINT`,
`BIRDSENSE_COSMOS_DATABASE`) and Blob Storage (`BIRDSENSE_BLOB_ENDPOINT`,
`BIRDSENSE_BLOB_CONTAINER`), and exits if they aren't configured.
`BIRDSENSE_STORAGE=local|azure` overrides where audio goes either way.
`BIRDSENSE_AUDIO_RETENTION_DAYS` (default 30) is how long a card's original
recordings are kept; set it to `0` in dev if you want a test card's audio to
stay put for good.
Sign-in needs `BIRDSENSE_OIDC_MICROSOFT_CLIENT_ID` and `_CLIENT_SECRET` (and
`_TENANT`, default `common`; `BIRDSENSE_OIDC_GOOGLE_*` the same way),
`BIRDSENSE_PUBLIC_URL` -- where a browser reaches the app, which the redirect
URI is built from and which has to match what is registered with the provider
-- and `BIRDSENSE_SESSION_KEY`, at least 32 bytes of it
(`openssl rand -base64 32`). Outside dev mode the server refuses to start
without them, because the development sign-in isn't registered there and it
would have no way in at all. Dev mode fills all four in (a random session key,
`http://localhost:8080`) and offers the roster picker instead, so the real flow
is opt-in locally: set the three Microsoft variables and register
`http://localhost:8080/api/v1/auth/microsoft/callback`, which providers allow
over plain http for localhost only.
`BIRDSENSE_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN="Name <email>"` adds the first admin to an empty
roster (required on a first deploy, see DEPLOYMENT.md). In dev it runs before
the seed, so setting it starts you from a clean roster. Outside dev mode it
refuses anyone from the placeholder roster, so dev people never reach Cosmos.

BirdNET, for the server's analysis queue, `internal/birdnet` and `cmd/analyze`
(needs Python 3.12; models download to `$BIRDNET_APP_DATA`, default
`~/.local/share/birdnet`, on first use). The server looks for
`../.venv/bin/python` and `../analyzer/analyze.py` from `backend/`
(`BIRDSENSE_BIRDNET_PYTHON`, `BIRDSENSE_BIRDNET_SCRIPT`); without them it keeps
saying so in the log, the coordinator's card screens say so too, and received
cards wait in `processing`:

```sh
python3.12 -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install -r analyzer/requirements.txt
cd backend && BIRDSENSE_BIRDNET_PYTHON=../.venv/bin/python go run ./cmd/analyze "../test/2026-09-09 Osprey.wav"
```

Perch as well (`BIRDSENSE_PERCH=on`, or `-model perch` on `cmd/analyze`) needs
TensorFlow on top, ~1.3 GB, and downloads its ~380 MB model on first use:

```sh
.venv/bin/pip install -r analyzer/requirements.txt -r analyzer/requirements-perch.txt
```

Container (compose sets `BIRDSENSE_DB=local` and `BIRDSENSE_STORAGE=local`, and
keeps the database and the audio in two named volumes):

```sh
HOST_PORT=8080 docker compose up --build
```

Checks before committing:

```sh
cd backend && gofmt -l . && go vet ./... && go test ./... && govulncheck ./...
```

`govulncheck` needs installing once
(`go install golang.org/x/vuln/cmd/govulncheck@latest`). It exits non-zero only
for an advisory this code can actually reach, so one against a module nothing
calls is reported without failing.

`TestAzure` in `internal/storage` runs the blob backend against Azurite, and is
skipped unless `BIRDSENSE_TEST_AZURITE` names its endpoint (the command is in
the test). Set it when changing `internal/storage` or the tusd version.

`TestAnalyzeOsprey` runs the real model, and `TestCutOsprey` the real
`clip.py`; both are skipped unless `BIRDSENSE_BIRDNET_PYTHON` names a Python
with `analyzer/requirements.txt` installed. Set it when changing
`internal/birdnet`, `analyze.py`, `clip.py`, or the pins. `TestPerchOsprey`
runs the real Perch, and also needs `BIRDSENSE_TEST_PERCH` set and
`requirements-perch.txt` installed.

BirdNET in the image, on the test clip:

```sh
docker compose run --rm -v "$PWD/test:/test:ro" --entrypoint /app/birdsense-analyze \
  birdsense "/test/2026-09-09 Osprey.wav"
```

## State of the code

Every handler reads and writes through `db.Store`; there is no in-memory data
left in `internal/api`. The API's JSON shapes live in `internal/api/shapes.go`
and differ from the stored documents in a few names. SCHEMA.md's *API mapping*
section is the rulebook for both the fields and what each write route does
(DELETE on people and stations sets `removedAt`/`retiredAt`; deleting a card
is the one hard delete, and takes its audio and detections with it).
`internal/api` tests build their own small fixed-date program in the JSON
backend, deliberately not the dev seed.

Sign-in is real: OpenID Connect against Microsoft, with the roster as the
allow-list (see *Sign-in* above). `POST /session {"role": ...}` still signs in
as the first person with that role, but only in dev mode. Google is written and
untested -- it needs a client id, a secret, and someone to try it.
The Cosmos DB backend and the Blob Storage backend have both run in Azure
against a real card: documents, uploads and analysis all work there. The
JSON-file backend and its tests still define the behaviour Cosmos must match.
Uploaded audio is stored, a card whose files are all in moves to `processing`,
and the analysis queue runs BirdNET over it in the server process, writing
`unreviewed` detections, each with a clip -- and, with `BIRDSENSE_PERCH` on,
Perch's detections after them, as a second list (see *Perch is a second
opinion* above). The coordinator's card page
(`/admin/uploads/{ref}`) shows each file's status, when its recording is due to
be removed or was, and what was heard in it, and
each detection has its own page with its clip, a spectrogram, and Confirm and
Discard. The Detections tab (`/app/detections`) lists every card's detections,
sortable by when, species or confidence and filtered by review, species,
minimum confidence and the days heard, and opens the same detection page, where Previous, Next and the arrow keys step
through the list as filtered and sorted rather than through the file. It
opens on the past week, with those dates in its own date fields, and widening
them past what one replica will read says so rather than failing.
Anyone signed in can review. Everyone works in the same shell
(`<bs-app-page>`): Upload, the default, holding the card upload's four steps;
My uploads, their own cards, where an unfinished one is resumed; and
Detections. A coordinator gets three more tabs after those -- All uploads,
Recorders and People. Nothing moves a card from `in_review`
to `results_sent` yet, and there is no email. Detections stored before clips
were cut have no clip and weren't merged, and ones stored before clips were
FLAC still have a WAV; nothing backfills either.
Nothing cleans up abandoned partial uploads, short of deleting their card or
the storage lifecycle rule getting to them: they have no `audioFiles` document,
so retention never sees them.
