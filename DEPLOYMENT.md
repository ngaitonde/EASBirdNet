# Birdsense — Azure deployment

This is the list of Azure resources Birdsense needs, with the settings that
matter. Every resource names its Terraform type, and every setting that differs
from the default is spelled out and explained. The data those resources hold is
described in [SCHEMA.md](SCHEMA.md).

`infra/` is this file as Terraform (`azurerm` provider), one file per group of
resources: `main.tf` (resource group, identity), `cosmos.tf`, `storage.tf`,
`registry.tf`, `app.tf` (logs, environment, container app),
`domain.tf` (the custom domain, if there is one), `monitor.tf` (the action
group, the alert rules and the cost budget), plus `variables.tf` and
`outputs.tf`. The short version of running it is in
[README.md](README.md#deploying); this file is the why. When the two disagree,
the Terraform is what runs -- fix this file.

Status: this stack is provisioned and running. Both data stores -- Cosmos DB
for documents and Blob Storage for card audio -- have run in Azure against a
real card. [Blob storage for uploads](#blob-storage-for-uploads) lists what the
storage side needs.

## Shape of it

```

- **One container** serves the API and the frontend (see CLAUDE.md), so there
  is no front door, CDN or second app.
- **No secrets.** Every data-plane call authenticates as the app's managed
  identity. Cosmos key auth and storage shared keys are turned off.
- **Local development doesn't use Azure at all** (`BIRDSENSE_DB=local`).

## Naming and region

| Setting      | Value |
|--------------|-------|
| Region       | `westus2`, the nearest region to the Eastside with serverless Cosmos DB and Container Apps. |
| Environment  | `prod` only, for now. Put `env` in a Terraform variable so a `staging` copy is a second `tfvars` file. |
| Name pattern | `<type>-birdsense-<env>`, following Azure's abbreviation list. Storage and ACR names allow only lowercase alphanumerics, so they drop the dashes. |
| Tags         | `app = birdsense`, `env = <env>`, `owner = eastside-audubon` |

Cosmos DB, storage and registry names are globally unique. If one is taken,
add a short suffix and update this file.

## Resources

### 1. Resource group — `azurerm_resource_group`

| Setting  | Value |
|----------|-------|
| name     | `rg-birdsense-prod` |
| location | `westus2` |

### 2. User-assigned managed identity — `azurerm_user_assigned_identity`

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| name    | `id-birdsense-prod` |

A user-assigned identity, not a system-assigned one, so its role assignments
can exist *before* the container app does. Otherwise the first revision
can't pull its image. Its `client_id` goes into the app's `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`.

### 3. Cosmos DB account — `azurerm_cosmosdb_account`

| Setting | Value | Why |
|---------|-------|-----|
| name | `cosmos-birdsense-prod` | |
| kind | `GlobalDocumentDB` | The NoSQL API. |
| offer_type | `Standard` | Required by the provider; serverless is set by the capability below. |
| capabilities | `EnableServerless` | Pay per request. The load is a few cards a week, not a steady rate. |
| consistency_policy | `Session` | The default. A writer reads its own writes. |
| geo_location | one: `westus2`, failover_priority 0, zone_redundant `false` | Serverless is single-region. |
| local_authentication_enabled | `false` | Entra ID only. No account keys to leak. (`local_authentication_disabled = true` says the same thing and is deprecated from provider v5.) |
| public_network_access_enabled | `true` | The consumption Container Apps environment has no VNet. Revisit with private endpoints if that changes. |
| minimal_tls_version | `Tls12` | |
| backup | `type = Continuous`, `tier = Continuous7Days` | Point-in-time restore of the last 7 days at no extra cost. |
| free_tier_enabled | `false` | Not compatible with serverless (see *Cost* for the alternative). |

### 4. Cosmos DB database — `azurerm_cosmosdb_sql_database`

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| name | `birdsense` |
| throughput | *unset* (serverless) |

### 5. Cosmos DB containers — `azurerm_cosmosdb_sql_container` ×5

All five share these settings: `partition_key_version = 2`, default indexing
policy (consistent, all paths included), no unique keys, no default TTL, no
throughput (serverless).

| name         | partition_key_paths |
|--------------|---------------------|
| `users`      | `["/id"]`           |
| `recorders`  | `["/id"]`           |
| `uploads`    | `["/id"]`           |
| `audioFiles` | `["/uploadId"]`     |
| `detections` | `["/uploadId"]`     |

**Names and partition keys can't be changed after creation** without copying
the data to a new container. They must match
`backend/internal/db/cosmos.go` exactly, and the container names are
case-sensitive.

The app never creates the database or containers. On startup it checks that
all five exist and exits if one is missing.

### 6. Cosmos DB data-plane role — `azurerm_cosmosdb_sql_role_assignment`

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| resource_group_name / account_name | the account above |
| role_definition_id | `${azurerm_cosmosdb_account.this.id}/sqlRoleDefinitions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000002` (**Cosmos DB Built-in Data Contributor**) |
| principal_id | `azurerm_user_assigned_identity.this.principal_id` |
| scope | `${azurerm_cosmosdb_account.this.id}/dbs/birdsense` |

This is a Cosmos **SQL role assignment**, not an ordinary Azure RBAC
`azurerm_role_assignment`. Portal roles like "Cosmos DB Account Reader" or
"DocumentDB Account Contributor" are control-plane roles and do **not** grant
reading or writing documents. The app needs no control-plane role at all.

### 7. Storage account — `azurerm_storage_account`

Holds the audio. At ~5.5 GB per recorder-day this is where the money goes,
which is why originals are kept for only a month (see *Audio retention* and
*Cost*).

| Setting | Value | Why |
|---------|-------|-----|
| name | `stbirdsenseprod` | |
| account_kind | `StorageV2` | |
| account_tier / account_replication_type | `Standard` / `LRS` | Originals are recoverable from the card for a while, and results live in Cosmos. Revisit if the archive must survive a datacenter loss. |
| access_tier | `Hot` | Lifecycle rules move old audio down. |
| shared_access_key_enabled | `false` | Entra ID only. Browsers upload through the app, which writes with its managed identity, so nothing needs an account key or a SAS. |
| allow_nested_items_to_be_public | `false` | |
| min_tls_version | `TLS1_2` | |
| blob_properties.delete_retention_policy | 7 days | Soft delete. |
| blob_properties.cors_rule | *unset* | Browsers never talk to the storage account. |

**Blob container** — `azurerm_storage_container`: name `audio`, access type
`private`. Card audio is at `uploads/{uploadId}/{random}`, each with a
`.info` blob beside it, and the clips the server cuts for review are at
`clips/{uploadId}/{detectionId}.flac`, well under a MB each (SCHEMA.md). The app tries to create the container at
startup and carries on if it exists; Terraform should still own it.

**Lifecycle** — `azurerm_storage_management_policy`, one rule on prefix
`audio/uploads/`. It deliberately never names `audio/clips/`, which stays hot:
clips are what retention keeps for good, and reviewers play them on demand.

The rule is **not** the retention policy. The app deletes originals itself
(*Audio retention* below), because only it knows whether BirdNET has finished
with a file and it has to mark the document either way. This rule is the net
underneath: it sweeps what the app never recorded — uploads abandoned part way,
and anything a failed delete left behind:

| Action | After | Why |
|--------|-------|-----|
| tier to cool | `audio_retention_days` + 30 days since last modification, so 60 by default | For the stragglers the app doesn't manage, which live until the delete below. Cool bills a 30-day minimum, so this deliberately clears the app's own date by a full cool period: the rule counts from each blob's last modification and the app counts from when the card was *received*, which is later by however long the card took to upload. Tiering at a flat 30 would put a normal card into cool hours before the app deletes it and bill a month of cool for the whole card. |
| delete | `audio_backstop_days`, 180 by default | Far enough out that it is never what removes a card normally. A card the app is deliberately holding — one whose analysis never finished — does lose its audio here, so don't tighten it towards the retention window. It also has to stay 30 days clear of the tier above, which `storage.tf` checks with a `precondition` at plan time. |
| tier to archive | *unset* | An archived blob can't be read without a rehydrate, and `internal/analysis` reads originals straight out of the container. |

### 8. Storage data-plane role — `azurerm_role_assignment`

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| scope | the storage account |
| role_definition_name | `Storage Blob Data Contributor` |
| principal_id | the managed identity |

### 9. Container registry — `azurerm_container_registry`

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| name | `crbirdsenseprod` |
| sku | `Basic` |
| admin_enabled | `false` |

**Pull role** — `azurerm_role_assignment`: scope the registry,
`AcrPull`, principal the managed identity.

### 10. Log Analytics workspace — `azurerm_log_analytics_workspace`

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| name | `log-birdsense-prod` |
| sku | `PerGB2018` |
| retention_in_days | `30` |

The server logs with `log/slog` to stdout, which the Container Apps
environment forwards here.

### 11. Container Apps environment — `azurerm_container_app_environment`

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| name | `cae-birdsense-prod` |
| log_analytics_workspace_id | the workspace above |
| workload profile | Consumption (the default; no dedicated profile) |

### 12. Container app — `azurerm_container_app`

| Setting | Value | Why |
|---------|-------|-----|
| name | `ca-birdsense-prod` | |
| revision_mode | `Single` | |
| identity | `UserAssigned`, the identity above | |
| registry | server `crbirdsenseprod.azurecr.io`, identity = the identity above | Pulls with AcrPull, no password. |
| container image | `crbirdsenseprod.azurecr.io/birdsense:<git sha>` | Built from the repo's `Dockerfile`, unchanged. |
| cpu / memory | `1` / `2Gi` | The server runs BirdNET over received cards (`internal/analysis`): one Python process at a time, peaking near 300 MB, which is CPU-bound for hours per card. On this much CPU expect very roughly 2 minutes per hour of audio, so a ~336-file card takes most of a day; more CPU is faster. With [Perch](#perch) on this has to be `2` / `4Gi`. Moving analysis to a job would let the web app go back to `0.25` / `0.5Gi`; see *Open questions*. |
| min_replicas / max_replicas | `1` / `1` | **Analysis needs a replica that stays up**: it runs in the background with no HTTP traffic, and a scale-to-zero replica is stopped mid-card. Nothing is lost when that happens (the queue is in Cosmos and resumes at the next start), but it stops until someone visits. `0` is fine again once analysis is a job. **Uploads need exactly one**: tusd locks an upload in the memory of the replica serving it (see [Blob storage for uploads](#blob-storage-for-uploads)), and two replicas would also analyze the same file twice. |
| ingress | external `true`, target_port `8080`, transport `auto`, allow_insecure_connections `false`, traffic 100% to latest revision | |
| startup probe | HTTP GET `/api/v1/health` on `8080`; `initial_delay` 5, `timeout` 5, every 10 s, 10 failures | ~100 s to come up, which is room for a cold start and not for a broken configuration -- that one exits at startup instead, and restarts the container. |
| liveness probe | HTTP GET `/api/v1/health` on `8080`; `initial_delay` 10, `timeout` 5, every 30 s, 10 failures | `/api/v1/health` answers 200 whatever the dependencies are doing, so only a process that has stopped answering at all restarts this container -- and only after five unbroken minutes of it. Restarting never fixes Cosmos, and this replica is the one analyzing a card. The same endpoint the Dockerfile `HEALTHCHECK` uses. |
| readiness probe | HTTP GET `/api/v1/ready` on `8080`; `timeout` 5, every 30 s, 3 failures, 1 success | The one probe that can fail. `/api/v1/ready` pings Cosmos and the blob container, so a replica that has lost either leaves ingress after ~90 s instead of serving 500s, and is back the first time a ping succeeds. |

Every probe value is set on purpose. The provider's defaults -- `timeout` 1,
every 10 s, 3 failures -- describe a container that isn't also running BirdNET
CPU-bound for hours on one vCPU, where a health response waiting behind it is
normal rather than a sick replica.


**Environment variables:**

| Name | Value | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| `BIRDSENSE_DB` | `cosmos` | The default. Set explicitly so the config reads plainly. |
| `BIRDSENSE_COSMOS_ENDPOINT` | `azurerm_cosmosdb_account.this.endpoint` | e.g. `https://cosmos-birdsense-prod.documents.azure.com:443/` |
| `BIRDSENSE_COSMOS_DATABASE` | `birdsense` | |
| `BIRDSENSE_STORAGE` | `azure` | The default outside dev mode. Set explicitly so the config reads plainly. |
| `BIRDSENSE_BLOB_ENDPOINT` | `azurerm_storage_account.this.primary_blob_endpoint` | e.g. `https://stbirdsenseprod.blob.core.windows.net/` (a trailing slash is fine). |
| `BIRDSENSE_BLOB_CONTAINER` | `audio` | The default. Set explicitly. |
| `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` | `azurerm_user_assigned_identity.this.client_id` | Tells the SDK *which* managed identity to use. Required for a user-assigned identity. |
| `AZURE_TOKEN_CREDENTIALS` | `ManagedIdentityCredential` | Stops `DefaultAzureCredential` trying developer credentials first in production. |
| `BIRDSENSE_AUDIO_RETENTION_DAYS` | `var.audio_retention_days`, default `30` | How long a card's original recordings are kept once BirdNET has finished with them; `0` keeps them for good. Detections and their clips are never removed by it. See [Audio retention](#audio-retention). |
| `BIRDSENSE_PERCH` | `on` when `var.perch_enabled`, else `off` (the default) | Runs Perch over every file after BirdNET, as a second list of detections. Needs the larger container; see [Perch](#perch). |
| `BIRDSENSE_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN` | `var.bootstrap_admin`, e.g. `Your Name <you@eastsideaudubon.org>` | **Required on the first deploy.** The first admin; see [First deploy](#first-deploy). |
| `BIRDSENSE_PUBLIC_URL` | `var.public_url`, or the container app's own `https://<fqdn>` when that is empty | Where browsers reach Birdsense. The redirect URI is built from it, so it must match one registered with the provider. Not taken from the request's `Host` header, which a caller chooses. |
| `BIRDSENSE_OIDC_MICROSOFT_CLIENT_ID` | `var.oidc_microsoft_client_id` | The Entra ID app registration; see [Sign-in](#sign-in). |
| `BIRDSENSE_OIDC_MICROSOFT_CLIENT_SECRET` | Container Apps secret `oidc-microsoft-client-secret` | Kept as a secret, so it isn't in the revision's environment listing. |
| `BIRDSENSE_OIDC_MICROSOFT_TENANT` | `var.oidc_microsoft_tenant`, default `common` | `common` accepts any organization and any personal Microsoft account. A tenant GUID restricts sign-in to that directory. |
| `BIRDSENSE_SESSION_KEY` | Container Apps secret `session-key` | Signs the session cookie. At least 32 characters, or the server won't start. Keep it stable across deploys; changing it signs everyone out. |
| `BIRDSENSE_ADDR`, `BIRDSENSE_STATIC_DIR`, `BIRDSENSE_STORAGE_DIR` | *unset* | Already set in the image (`:8080`, `/app/frontend`, and `/app/audio`, which only local storage uses). |
| `BIRDSENSE_BIRDNET_PYTHON`, `BIRDSENSE_BIRDNET_SCRIPT`, `BIRDNET_APP_DATA` | *unset* | Already set in the image, pointing at its BirdNET venv, `analyze.py` and the models baked in at build time. The analysis queue checks them before it starts, and again on a growing delay until they work, logging `BirdNET isn't available` (and analyzing nothing) meanwhile. `/api/v1/health` reports `"queue":"unavailable"`, and the coordinator's card screens say so; see *When cards sit in processing*. |

Never set `BIRDSENSE_COSMOS_KEY` in Azure. It exists only for the emulator.

**Custom domain** (optional): the app answers on its own
`<app>.<region>.azurecontainerapps.io` hostname until one is bound, and binding
one is `infra/domain.tf` plus two DNS records, a certificate and a change of
`public_url`, in that order. [Custom domain](#custom-domain) is the whole of
it.

### 13. Action group — `azurerm_monitor_action_group`

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| name | `ag-birdsense-prod` |
| short_name | `birdsense` (at most 12 characters; it prefixes the mail subject) |
| email_receiver | one per address in `var.alert_emails`, common alert schema |

Every rule below mails this one group, and it is the only place addresses are
listed. `alert_emails` is required and has no default: see
[What is watched](#what-is-watched).

### 14. Alert rules — `azurerm_monitor_metric_alert` ×2, `azurerm_monitor_scheduled_query_rules_alert_v2`, `azurerm_monitor_activity_log_alert` ×2

| Rule | Type | Fires on |
|------|------|----------|
| `alert-birdsense-prod-replica-restarts` | metric, `RestartCount` max > 0 over 5 min, severity 2 | The one replica restarting: a BirdNET run cut mid-file, every upload in flight back to its last chunk. |
| `alert-birdsense-prod-5xx` | metric, `Requests` total > 5 over 15 min, dimension `statusCodeCategory` = `5xx`, severity 1 | The app returning server errors. Not zero: one 500 is a log line, several in a quarter of an hour is a pattern. |
| `alert-birdsense-prod-birdnet-unavailable` | scheduled query over Log Analytics, every 15 min, severity 2 | The console log carrying `BirdNET isn't available`, which means received cards are piling up in `processing`. |
| `alert-birdsense-prod-service-health` | activity log, `ServiceHealth`, subscription scope | An Azure incident or planned maintenance in `westus2`. All services, not a named list: a service name that doesn't match Azure's exactly matches nothing, silently. |
| `alert-birdsense-prod-resource-health` | activity log, `ResourceHealth`, resource group scope | Azure reporting any resource in the group as degraded or unavailable. |

The two metric rules need no diagnostic setting and no ingestion: Container
Apps emits platform metrics whether or not anything reads them. The activity
log rules are free.

**Gotcha:** `RestartCount` is a replica's own count, reported for as long as
that replica lives, so that alert stays fired rather than clearing once the
window is quiet. With exactly one replica that is the honest reading -- the
replica that restarted is still the one serving -- but it has to be
acknowledged rather than waited out. A deploy replaces the replica and clears
it.

**Gotcha:** the query rule matches a *field*, `parse_json(Log_s).msg`, which is
why `cmd/server` logs JSON rather than `slog`'s text format. tusd writes its own
warnings to stdout as text (CLAUDE.md, *Card audio goes over tus*); those lines
don't parse and fall out of the query on their own. It follows that the rule
only matches once an image that logs JSON is the one running: `scripts/deploy.ps1`
builds and applies together so an ordinary deploy does both at once, but a
settings-only apply against an older `image_tag` creates a rule that finds
nothing until the next deploy.

### 15. Cost budget — `azurerm_consumption_budget_resource_group`

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| name | `budget-birdsense-prod` |
| amount | `var.budget_monthly_usd`, default `150` |
| time_grain | `Monthly`, starting the first of the month it was created |
| notification | 80% of actual, and a forecast over 100%, both to the action group |

A notification, not a cap: Azure budgets stop nothing. It is here because the
bill is the one thing that changes without anybody touching anything -- clips
are kept for good and add roughly a terabyte a year at five recorders
(*Cost*). `time_period` is derived from the current month so a first apply
needs no date in a tfvars file, and is then under `ignore_changes` so that
derivation doesn't re-plan every month.

## Sign-in

Volunteers sign in with OpenID Connect, and the roster is the allow-list: the
provider proves which address someone owns, and a coordinator having added that
address is what lets them in. Nothing in Azure holds passwords. The server
refuses to start outside dev mode without a provider configured, because the
development sign-in isn't registered there and it would have no way in at all.

**The app registration** lives in Entra ID, which is a *directory* object, not
an Azure resource: Contributor, Owner or Role Based Access Control
Administrator on the subscription grant nothing here. Creating one needs either
the tenant's "Users can register applications" setting left on, or the
**Application Developer** directory role (Entra ID → Roles and administrators),
which allows it even when that setting is off. Whoever creates a registration
becomes its owner and can manage its redirect URIs and secrets afterwards.
Terraform does not own it: it is created once, by hand, in a directory that may
not be the one the subscription lives in.

Set it up as:

| | |
|---|---|
| Supported account types | **Accounts in any organizational directory and personal Microsoft accounts.** Volunteers use the address they already have, which is usually not an Eastside Audubon one. Safe because the roster, not the audience, decides who gets in. |
| Redirect URI (Web) | `<public URL>/api/v1/auth/microsoft/callback`. Register one per hostname the app answers on -- the `azurecontainerapps.io` one for testing, the custom domain when it exists, and `http://localhost:8080/...` for development, which providers allow over plain http for localhost only. They coexist; adding one is additive. |
| Client secret | Copy the **value**, not the secret id, into `oidc_microsoft_client_secret`. Note its expiry: a secret that lapses stops all sign-in. |
| Optional claim (ID token) | **`xms_edov`**. See below -- without it, volunteers on a domain belonging to some *other* organization's tenant are refused. |
| API permissions | `openid`, `profile`, `email` (Microsoft Graph, delegated). All user-consentable, so no admin consent is needed unless the tenant restricts user consent, in which case an Application Administrator grants it once. |

**Why `xms_edov` matters.** Accepting any Microsoft account means accepting
every organization's directory, and a directory's administrators choose what
their own users' `email` claims say -- including a roster member's address.
Birdsense therefore believes an email claim only when the provider is in a
position to know it: a personal Microsoft account (the address *is* the
account), an organization that has proved to Microsoft it owns the domain
(`xms_edov`), or Google's `email_verified`. Anything else is refused and logged
as `unverified-email`. The rule is `trustedEmail` in `internal/api/auth.go`.

**The session key** (`session_key`, a Container Apps secret) signs the session
cookie. Generate it with `openssl rand -base64 32` and keep it: a new value
signs everyone out, which is also how to end every session at once on purpose.
It must be at least 32 characters -- the cookie it signs is the identity, so a
short one is a forgeable admin session. `terraform plan` refuses a shorter one,
and so does the server at startup, which is what covers a deployment that sets
`BIRDSENSE_SESSION_KEY` some other way.

**Adding Google** is two more variables and no code:
`oidc_google_client_id` and `_secret` would follow the same shape, and the
sign-in page grows a second button on its own -- `GET /api/v1/session` reports
which providers the server has, and the page renders a button per provider.

## Custom domain

Out of the box the app answers on `ca-birdsense-prod.<region>.azurecontainerapps.io`,
which works and is unmemorable. A name like `owls.eastsideaudubon.org` is three
separate things: two DNS records, a hostname bound to the app with a
certificate, and the app being told it has moved. `infra/domain.tf` owns the
middle one. The first is DNS, which is hosted outside Azure and so is nobody's
to automate here; the last is `public_url` and the identity provider, and is
deliberately last.

**It has to be done in stages**, and the order is forced: Azure checks the DNS
records while it creates the custom domain, so the records exist first -- but
the value one of them carries comes from the container app, which already
exists. Nothing here is a chicken-and-egg problem, as long as the steps are in
this order. Everything before step 5 is invisible to anyone using the app.

### 1. Read what the records need

Both values are attributes of the container app **as it already runs**, so
there is nothing to deploy first and nothing in `domain.tf` to set yet:

```sh
terraform -chdir=infra output -raw app_fqdn
terraform -chdir=infra console   # then: nonsensitive(azurerm_container_app.this.custom_domain_verification_id)
```

`console` reads the attribute straight out of the state file. `nonsensitive()`
is needed because the provider marks that attribute sensitive -- it is a value
we are about to publish in DNS, so there is nothing to protect. Or ask Azure
and skip Terraform entirely:

```sh
az containerapp show --resource-group rg-birdsense-prod --name ca-birdsense-prod \
  --query properties.customDomainVerificationId --output tsv
```

**`terraform output -raw custom_domain_verification_id` only works after an
apply.** An output isn't a thing that exists in Azure; it is written into the
state file when Terraform applies, so an output added to `outputs.tf` is
invisible to `terraform output` until then. Adding one is not a deploy: the
plan says `No changes` with a `Changes to Outputs` block, no revision starts
and nothing restarts. Apply it whenever it's convenient -- or just use one of
the two commands above and never think about it.

### 2. Create the two records

| Name | Type | Value | What it does |
|------|------|-------|--------------|
| `owls` | CNAME | the app's hostname | Sends the name to the Container Apps environment. |
| `asuid.owls` | TXT | the verification id | Proves we own the name, so nobody else can bind it. |

`eastsideaudubon.org` is hosted outside Azure, so both are made by hand at
whoever hosts the zone and Terraform is told nothing about them: `infra/` has
no `azurerm_dns_*` resources, and this step is not something an apply can do.
Give them a short TTL if the host allows one -- they are made once, and the
cost of a typo is waiting for it to expire before Azure will look again.

Both have to resolve **publicly** before step 3: Azure looks them up from
outside, so a hosts file or a private resolver can't stand in. Check from
somewhere off our network:

```sh
dig +short owls.eastsideaudubon.org CNAME
dig +short asuid.owls.eastsideaudubon.org TXT
```

Between here and step 4 the name resolves to an ingress that doesn't know it
yet: HTTPS gets a certificate-name warning, because the environment's wildcard
certificate doesn't cover our name, and past it Azure's own 404. That is the
expected state at this point, not a mistake.

### 3. Bind the hostname

Set it in `prod.tfvars` and apply:

```hcl
custom_domain = "owls.eastsideaudubon.org"
```

```powershell
$tag = (terraform "-chdir=infra" output -raw image_tag)
terraform "-chdir=infra" apply "-var-file=prod.tfvars" "-var" "image_tag=$tag"
```

Applying the tag that is already running is how any settings change goes out
without a rebuild ([README.md](README.md#deploying)). Nothing about the
container app changes here, so no new revision starts and no upload in flight
is cut.

That creates `azurerm_container_app_custom_domain` -- the only resource the
custom domain has -- and Azure reads the `asuid` TXT record while it does. `Failed to validate the custom hostname` means the
records aren't resolving yet -- wait for the TTL and apply again; nothing is
half-created. The hostname arrives **unbound**: there is no certificate, so
HTTPS on the new name still fails. That is step 4.

### 4. Issue the certificate

```sh
az containerapp hostname bind --resource-group rg-birdsense-prod \
  --name ca-birdsense-prod --hostname owls.eastsideaudubon.org \
  --environment cae-birdsense-prod --validation-method CNAME
```

`--environment` is what asks for a *managed* certificate: it is where the
certificate is created, and the alternative is `--certificate` naming one that
already exists. Leaving both out is
`Please specify at least one of parameters: --certificate and --environment`,
not a default.

That issues Azure's free **managed certificate** and binds it, which takes a
few minutes. Azure renews it from then on, so there is no expiry to diarize --
unlike the client secret. It is the one thing in this stack created outside
Terraform, and it doesn't become drift: the two fields it fills in
(`certificate_binding_type` and `container_app_environment_certificate_id`) are
in the custom domain's `ignore_changes`, or the next apply would want to
replace the binding and take the certificate with it.

It is a command rather than a resource because the provider has no way to point
a custom domain at a managed certificate: the writable field takes an
environment *certificate* id, and a managed one is a different resource type
(`managedCertificates`), which it refuses. `azurerm_container_app_environment_managed_certificate`
will create such a certificate, but nothing can attach it -- so this is the
pattern the provider's own documentation gives. Bringing our own certificate
would be `azurerm_container_app_environment_certificate` and that field
instead, and then renewing it every year would be ours to remember.

### 5. Move the app onto it

Two steps, in this order, because the app builds its redirect URI from
`public_url` and the provider rejects one it doesn't know:

1. Register `https://owls.eastsideaudubon.org/api/v1/auth/microsoft/callback`
   as a redirect URI on the Entra app registration. Adding one is additive --
   the `azurecontainerapps.io` one keeps working, so there is no window where
   sign-in is broken.
2. Set `public_url = "https://owls.eastsideaudubon.org"` in `prod.tfvars` and
   apply it the same way as step 3. Until this, a volunteer who arrives on the
   new name is still sent back to the old one after signing in:
   `BIRDSENSE_PUBLIC_URL` is configuration, not the request's `Host` header
   (see [Container app](#12-container-app--azurerm_container_app)). This one
   *is* a change to the container app, so it starts a new revision.

Both names serve the app afterwards, and the old one is the fallback if
anything is wrong. The session cookie is scoped to the host that set it, so
everyone signs in once more on the new name; nothing else moves.

**What this doesn't cover.** The zone apex (`eastsideaudubon.org` itself)
can't be a CNAME. Azure supports an apex -- an A record to the Container Apps
environment's static IP, with the same `asuid` TXT record -- but that IP is
only stable for the life of the environment, so a subdomain is the one to
choose. Nothing redirects the old hostname to the new one; both answer. And
there is no `www` alias: a second name means a second
`azurerm_container_app_custom_domain` and a second certificate.

## Ordering

Terraform infers most of this from references, but two dependencies are
invisible to it:

1. The **AcrPull**, **Cosmos SQL role** and **Storage Blob Data Contributor**
   assignments must exist before the container app's first revision. Otherwise
   the image pull fails, or the app exits at startup because it can't read the
   Cosmos containers or reach the blob container. Add them to the app's
   `depends_on`.
2. Role assignments take a minute or two to propagate. A first `apply` can
   still race them. If the first revision fails, re-apply or restart the
   revision; it is not a config error.
3. Creating the `audio` blob container is a **data-plane** call, and shared
   keys are off, so the principal running Terraform needs Storage Blob Data
   Contributor on the storage account -- Owner on the subscription grants no
   data actions. `infra/storage.tf` assigns it (`grant_operator_blob_access`,
   default true) and the provider is configured with `storage_use_azuread`.
   This is the same role to give yourself in *Developing against real Blob
   Storage* below.
4. The **registry must exist before the container app's first apply**, because
   a revision can't be created pointing at an image that isn't there. Hence the
   one-time `apply -target=azurerm_container_registry.this` in README.md. It is
   only ever needed once, for an empty subscription.

## First deploy

A new database has an empty `users` container, and only an admin can add
people to the roster. So the **first deploy must set
`BIRDSENSE_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN`** to the coordinator who will run the program,
as `Name <email>` or just the email. That address is the one they sign in with
through Google or Microsoft. Make it a Terraform variable (`bootstrap_admin`)
with no default, so a first `apply` can't go ahead without it.

On startup the server adds that person as an admin **only if the roster is
empty**, and logs `added the bootstrap admin to an empty roster`. Every other
start does nothing, so the variable is safe to leave set: it can't make someone
admin again after they've been demoted, removed or given a new address. If the
roster isn't empty and the address isn't on it, the server logs a warning and
carries on. A typo on the first deploy has to be fixed in the Cosmos Data
Explorer, because the roster is no longer empty.

Outside dev mode the server **refuses to start** if the bootstrap admin's name
or address is someone from the development placeholder roster
(`internal/devseed`), or if the address is on a reserved example domain
(`example.com`, `*.test`, ...). Dev placeholder people never go into Cosmos:
the seed that writes them only runs in dev mode, against the JSON file.

## Deploying a new version

```powershell
./scripts/deploy.ps1
```

**Terraform owns the image tag.** The script builds the image and then applies
`-var image_tag=<sha>`, so one thing decides what is running, a rollback is
applying an older tag, and `terraform plan` is never wrong about the app. The
alternative -- `lifecycle { ignore_changes = [template[0].container[0].image] }`
with deploys done by `az containerapp update` -- is the right split only once
deploys run from CI with an identity that has no Terraform state access. Until
then, nothing should `az containerapp update` this app: that is drift the next
`apply` reverts.

The script builds with `az acr build` rather than a local `docker build`. That
needs no local Docker, downloads the BirdNET models over Azure's network rather
than yours, and produces a `linux/amd64` image whatever the machine running it
is -- an arm64 image (an Apple Silicon `docker build`) starts and dies in
Container Apps with an exec format error.

`az acr build` uploads the whole build context to the registry's source
storage, and the repo it is run from holds `infra/prod.tfvars` -- the OIDC
client secret and the session key in plaintext -- next to `infra/.terraform`.
So `.dockerignore` is an allow-list: `*`, then back in only the three
directories the Dockerfile copies (`backend`, `analyzer`, `frontend`). A new
file has to be named there before it can leave the machine, which is the right
way round for a context that goes to a registry. The script checks that shape
before it builds, because the failure is silent from this end.

Two rules the script enforces, both about the tag being the commit sha:

- It refuses a dirty working tree, so what's deployed is something that can be
  checked out. `-AllowDirty` appends a timestamp instead.
- A tag is never reused. Container Apps keys revisions off the image *string*,
  so re-pushing a tag the app already runs creates no new revision at all: the
  deploy would look like it worked and change nothing.

**A deploy during an upload cuts that upload, on purpose.** The old revision
gets its signal, gives live requests ten seconds, and then closes whatever is
still running. A card's 50 MB tus PATCH on a home connection rarely fits in
that window, and waiting for it would only push the process past Container
Apps' 30 s termination grace period and be killed anyway -- so the request is
cut, the browser's tus client resumes that file against the new revision from
the last chunk the old one stored, and the container exits 0. In the logs it
is one Warn line, not a failure: a revision swap mid-upload is normal, if
still worth avoiding when you know a card is coming in.

**Rolling back** is the same script with an earlier tag
(`./scripts/deploy.ps1 -ListTags`, then `-ImageTag <sha>`), which skips the
build entirely. [ROLLBACK.md](ROLLBACK.md) is the whole procedure, including
what a rollback does *not* undo.

Terraform's own state lives in a storage account created by hand, outside this
configuration (see [README.md](README.md#one-time-setup)). Terraform owning the
state it depends on is a knot nobody wants to untie at 11pm.

## What is watched

Log Analytics has always collected the app's logs. Resources 13-15 are what
reads them, and the answer to "would anybody find out?" for each of the ways
this deployment goes wrong quietly. Everything mails `var.alert_emails`; there
is no paging and no ticketing, because this is a volunteer-run program and the
useful question is whether anyone finds out, not how fast.

`alert_emails` is required and has no default. An unwatched stack is exactly
what these resources exist to fix, so a fresh apply -- a staging copy, or a
rebuild from scratch -- should not be able to come up unwatched by saying
nothing. Give it a chapter distribution list rather than one person's address.

| Goes wrong | Found out by |
|------------|--------------|
| The replica restarts, cutting a BirdNET run and every upload in flight | `alert-...-replica-restarts` |
| The app serves 500s | `alert-...-5xx` |
| BirdNET can't be imported, so received cards pile up in `processing` | `alert-...-birdnet-unavailable`, and *When cards sit in processing* below |
| Cosmos, storage or the app is degraded as far as the platform can see | `alert-...-resource-health` |
| Azure is having an incident in the region | `alert-...-service-health` |
| The bill climbs, which it does on its own because clips never expire | `budget-birdsense-prod` |

And what still isn't watched, which matters as much:

- **Whether the site is reachable at all.** With one replica and little
  traffic, a dead app serves no requests, so the 5xx rule stays quiet; only
  resource health would notice, and only if the platform notices. What
  actually covers this is an external ping -- an Application Insights standard
  web test against `/api/v1/ready`, which 503s when Cosmos or the blob
  container is unreachable -- and that costs a resource this stack otherwise
  doesn't need.
- **The Entra ID client secret expiring**, which stops every sign-in for
  everyone. Azure Monitor has nothing to alert on here: an app registration's
  credential is not a resource and emits no metrics. Its expiry date is a date
  somebody has to have written down, or the credential has to stop being one
  that expires. See TODO.md 5.12.
- **Cosmos 429s.** The SDK retries them, and serverless throttling during a
  bulk upsert is expected rather than broken, so a rule would be tuned against
  noise before anyone knows what normal looks like here.

## When cards sit in processing

A card that has been received is analyzed by the queue inside the running app
(CLAUDE.md, *The analysis queue is the database*). There is one replica, so if
that queue isn't working, every received card stops where it is -- and audio
that hasn't been analyzed is audio that retention refuses to delete, so nothing
is lost while it waits.

**Ask the app first.** `GET /api/v1/health` answers `"queue"` with one word,
without a session:

| `queue` | What it means |
|---------|---------------|
| `ready` | BirdNET runs here and the last pass got through. |
| `starting` | The first BirdNET check is still running (seconds, at most a minute). |
| `unavailable` | BirdNET can't run in this container at all. |
| `failing` | BirdNET runs, but a pass stopped on something else -- Cosmos, blob storage -- and is being retried. |
| `off` | This build runs no queue. Not a thing the deployed image does. |

`/api/v1/ready` is a different question and answers about this replica's
dependencies, not about analysis: a queue that can't start leaves the site
working, so it never takes a replica out of ingress. See *Container app*.

Signed in as a coordinator, *All uploads* and any card's page say the same
thing in words, with the error the server got and since when. That is the
first place to look, and it is there so that nobody has to read container logs
to find out why a volunteer's card hasn't moved.

**Recovering.** The queue keeps checking, so most of this fixes itself:

- `unavailable` means the image or its settings are wrong -- the venv,
  `analyze.py` or the models aren't where `BIRDSENSE_BIRDNET_*` says. Nothing
  at runtime fixes that: deploy a good image, or roll back to one
  ([ROLLBACK.md](ROLLBACK.md)). The cards are picked up as soon as the new
  revision comes up, in the order they were received.
- `failing` is usually the identity losing a role, or Cosmos throttling. Fix
  the cause; no restart is needed, because the queue retries the pass on its
  own.
- If a restart really is wanted -- to clear a wedged run rather than a
  configuration -- restart the revision, which changes nothing Terraform owns:

  ```sh
  az containerapp revision restart -n ca-birdsense-prod -g rg-birdsense-prod \
     --revision "$(az containerapp show -n ca-birdsense-prod -g rg-birdsense-prod \
                   --query properties.latestRevisionName -o tsv)"
  ```

  This is not `az containerapp update`, which would be drift the next
  `terraform apply` reverts. Nothing is lost by it: a file cut off mid-run is
  queued again, and detection ids are deterministic, so a re-run overwrites.

## Blob storage for uploads

Card audio reaches the storage account through the app, never straight from
the browser. Each file on a card is a tus upload to `/api/v1/tus/`, and the app
runs tusd's Azure store (`backend/internal/storage`): each request's bytes are
staged as a block, and the block list is committed when the last byte lands.
It signs in with `DefaultAzureCredential`, which here is the managed identity,
as for Cosmos. The code has run against Azure, and against Azurite with a
shared key -- which is not a perfect stand-in: `skipEmpty` in
`backend/internal/storage/storage.go` documents a call Azure rejects and
Azurite accepts.

What it needs, beyond resources 7 and 8:

- **Settings** on the container app: `BIRDSENSE_STORAGE`,
  `BIRDSENSE_BLOB_ENDPOINT` and `BIRDSENSE_BLOB_CONTAINER` (see *Environment
  variables*).
- **Storage Blob Data Contributor** for the identity (resource 8). Besides
  reading and writing blobs, the app tries to create the container at startup,
  and exits if that fails for any reason other than the container already
  existing.
- **One replica.** tusd holds an upload's lock in memory while a request writes
  to it, so every request for one upload has to reach the same replica: keep
  `max_replicas = 1`. More replicas need ingress session affinity (sticky
  sessions) or a shared locker in `internal/storage`. Scaling to zero between
  uploads is fine; an upload resumes from what's stored.
- **Ephemeral disk.** The Azure store writes each request body to a temp file
  before staging it. The browser sends at most 50 MB a request and one file at
  a time, so that is 50 MB per volunteer uploading at once, against the
  replica's ephemeral storage allowance. Analysis downloads one whole file at a
  time to temp storage (a few hundred MB), cuts its clips beside it, and
  deletes both after.
- **Request time.** The Container Apps ingress ends a request after 240 s. At
  50 MB a request that holds down to about 2 Mb/s of upstream; for slower links,
  lower `CHUNK_BYTES` in `frontend/js/upload-flow.js`. Deleting a card is the
  other request that has to fit: it removes a few hundred recordings and, with
  them, tens of thousands of clips and documents. Blobs go in Blob Batch
  requests of 256 and documents in Cosmos transactional batches of 100, several
  of each in flight, which is a few hundred round-trips rather than tens of
  thousands. One request per blob or per document does not fit.
- **CPU and memory while a card uploads.** Every byte of a ~128 GB card passes
  through the container, for the hours the upload takes. Inbound transfer is
  free, and the app only copies bytes, but at `0.25` vCPU the upload rate may
  be CPU-bound. Watch the replica's CPU during the first real card, and raise
  cpu/memory if it sits at the limit.
- **Leftovers.** An upload that never finishes leaves uncommitted blocks, which
  Azure discards after 7 days, and a `.info` blob, which stays. A finished
  file's `.info` blob goes when the file does, under retention or with the card;
  an abandoned one has no document naming it, so only the lifecycle rule's
  delete action sweeps it. See *Open questions*.

## Audio retention

**A card's original recordings are kept for a month; its detections and their
clips are kept for good.** At ~5.5 GB a recorder-day against ~0.7 GB of clips,
keeping originals is most of the storage bill in any one month -- though the
clips, which never expire, pass them within the year (*Cost*) -- and nothing
reads an original once BirdNET has: `internal/analysis` is
the only reader of `audio/uploads/`, and the only audio a browser ever plays is
a clip.

The app does the deleting, in `backend/internal/retention`, running in the
server process beside the analysis queue. It sweeps every few hours, and only
touches files BirdNET has finished with on cards it has finished with — a card
still being analyzed keeps its audio however old it is. It deletes the blob and
its `.info`, then marks the `audioFiles` document (`audioDeletedAt`, and
`blobName` cleared) and the card. Nothing under `audio/clips/` is ever named.
The rules and the failure ordering are in SCHEMA.md, *Audio retention*.

| Setting | Where | Default | What it does |
|---------|-------|---------|--------------|
| `audio_retention_days` | `infra/variables.tf` → `BIRDSENSE_AUDIO_RETENTION_DAYS` | 30 | The policy. `0` keeps originals until someone deletes the card. |
| `audio_backstop_days` | `infra/variables.tf` → the lifecycle rule | 180 | The net for what the app never recorded. Not the policy; see resource 7. Must stay at least 60 days past `audio_retention_days`, which resource 7 checks at plan time. |

Why the app rather than the lifecycle rule alone: the rule is prod-only, so dev
would behave differently; it can't tell an analyzed file from one still queued;
and it would leave `blobName` claiming audio that has gone.

Two things to know before this is switched on in production:

- **A card can't be re-analyzed after its window.** A better model, or a lower
  threshold, can only be run against cards still inside it. That is the real
  cost of the policy, and it is what the backstop's generous default protects
  a little of.
- **Detections stored before clips were cut have no clip**, and nothing
  backfills them (CLAUDE.md, *State of the code*). Once their originals go
  they are clipless for good, so backfill first if any are in Cosmos.

## Developing against real Blob Storage

Normal local development uses `BIRDSENSE_STORAGE=local` and needs none of this.
To run a laptop against a real storage account (e.g. to test
`internal/storage`):

1. Give your own Entra user Storage Blob Data Contributor on a non-production
   account (`grant_operator_blob_access`, resource 8). Keep it off the
   production account.
2. `az login`
3. Run, leaving the documents in the JSON file:
   ```sh
   cd backend
   BIRDSENSE_DB=local BIRDSENSE_STORAGE=azure \
   BIRDSENSE_BLOB_ENDPOINT=https://<account>.blob.core.windows.net \
   go run ./cmd/server
   ```

Upload a folder of a few large `.wav` files. Blobs appear under
`audio/uploads/{card}/`, each with a `.info` blob, and a file's own blob only
once it is complete. Pausing mid-file and resuming carries on from the last
50 MB chunk rather than starting over.

## Developing against real Cosmos DB

Normal local development uses `BIRDSENSE_DB=local` and needs none of this. To
run a laptop against the Azure account (e.g. to test `cosmos.go`):

1. Give your own Entra user the same data role (step 6). Your user's object id
   goes in `principal_id`. Keep it scoped to the database, and prefer a
   non-production account.
2. `az login`
3. Run:
   ```sh
   cd backend
   BIRDSENSE_DB=cosmos \
   BIRDSENSE_COSMOS_ENDPOINT=https://cosmos-birdsense-prod.documents.azure.com:443/ \
   go run ./cmd/server
   ```
   `DefaultAzureCredential` picks up the Azure CLI login.

**Emulator** (untested). The Cosmos DB Linux emulator accepts the well-known
emulator key via `BIRDSENSE_COSMOS_KEY`. Create the `birdsense` database and the
five containers first (same partition keys), since the app won't. Run the
emulator over HTTP, or trust its self-signed certificate, or the Go client will
refuse the TLS handshake.

## Perch

**Perch is off unless `perch_enabled` turns it on.** With it on, the analysis
queue runs Google's Perch v2 over every file BirdNET has finished with, as a
step of its own, and stores what it heard beside BirdNET's detections, each
marked with its model. It is an internal detail: volunteers never choose a
model, and the Detections tab they share with coordinators is BirdNET's alone.
Only a coordinator's card page shows it -- how far Perch has got with each
file, and what it heard under BirdNET's. Nothing else changes: the public page counts BirdNET's confirmed detections
only, since a bird both models heard would otherwise count twice, and Perch
failing on a file leaves BirdNET's result on it and the card doesn't need
attention for it (SCHEMA.md, `audioFiles.perch`).

The image always carries it -- TensorFlow (`analyzer/requirements-perch.txt`,
~1.3 GB) and the model (~400 MB) -- so the switch is the variable, not a
rebuild. That adds about 1.7 GB to the image, which is slower pulls on a new
revision and a little more registry storage.

What it costs, measured on 10 minutes of audio with one worker:

| | BirdNET | Perch |
|---|---|---|
| Time | 25 s | 73 s |
| Peak memory (whole process tree) | ~300 MB | ~2.5 GB |

So **turning it on needs `cpu = 2.0` and `memory = "4Gi"`** -- Perch alone is
more than the default 2Gi replica, and it would be killed on every file.
`infra/app.tf` refuses `perch_enabled` with less than 4Gi at plan time. The
larger replica roughly doubles the app's compute bill, and a card takes about
four times as long to finish, because it stays in `processing` until Perch has
been over every file (and keeps its audio until then: retention only sweeps
finished cards). BirdNET doesn't wait for it: the queue catches BirdNET up on
every card before each Perch file, so a new card's detections still arrive
first.

If the image can't run Perch (a build without TensorFlow), a server with it on
says so the way it does for BirdNET -- `queue` is `unavailable`, and cards wait
in `processing` -- rather than quietly finishing cards without it. Turning it
off again lets waiting cards finish without it.

## Cost

Rough order of magnitude at five recorders. **The unit is a recorder-day, not a
card.** A card is however many days of recording happen to fit on it, so
anything reasoned per card stops being true the moment the rotation, the card
or the recorder's settings change -- and multiplying a card's capacity by a
card count over-counts, because a card is swapped when it comes out of the
field, not when it is full.

Measured on real cards, one recorder yields about **4,000 detections a day**
from about **5.5 GB of audio**, and a clip runs about **170 KB** (a 3 s
detection plus a second either side, FLAC). Check the Azure pricing calculator
before relying on any of this.

| Item | Volume | Cost driver |
|------|--------|-------------|
| Audio in blob storage | 5 recorders × ~5.5 GB a day, held a month ≈ **830 GB**, flat | Originals are deleted a month after a card is received (*Audio retention*), so this doesn't grow: tens of dollars a month of hot LRS. Without the policy it would be ~10 TB by the end of a year, several hundred dollars a month. |
| Clips in blob storage | ~0.7 GB per recorder-day ≈ **1.3 TB a year**, and kept for good | The only line that only ever grows. It passes the entire originals footprint after about eight months, and adds roughly $25 a month to the bill for every further year the program runs. What halves it is a higher detection threshold or a lossy clip format; see TODO.md 3.4. |
| Cosmos DB, serverless | ~175k audio-file docs; **~7.7M detection docs a year, ~4.6 GB**, kept as long as their clips | Cheap per unit -- a few dollars a year in request units, plus storage per GB-month. The document count matters more for the detections list than for the bill: see `db.MaxDetectionScan`. |
| Container Apps | low traffic, scale to zero | Usually within the monthly free grant, including the few hours of active replica each card upload takes. |
| Container Registry Basic | one small image | A few dollars a month. |
| Log Analytics | low volume | Within the free ingestion allowance at this scale. |
| Azure Monitor alerts | 2 metric rules, 1 log query rule, 2 activity log rules | Pennies. Activity log rules and emailed notifications are free; metric rules are billed per monitored time series and the query rule per evaluation, at a 15-minute cadence. |

*Alternative for Cosmos.* One Cosmos account per subscription can use the free
tier (1000 RU/s and 25 GB free) with provisioned, database-level shared
throughput instead of serverless. It costs nothing until it's outgrown, but bulk
detection ingestion would be throttled (the SDK retries 429s). Worth it if the
account budget is tight; switching means a new account, since capacity mode
can't be changed in place.

## Open questions that change this file

- **Custom domain**: which name. How to bind one is settled and written down
  ([Custom domain](#custom-domain)), and `eastsideaudubon.org` is hosted
  outside Azure, so the two DNS records are always somebody's manual step and
  whoever administers that zone has to make them.
- **Secrets**: the client secret and session key are Container Apps secrets,
  which means they are in the Terraform state file. Key Vault with the app's
  managed identity reading them would keep them out of state, and would give
  the client secret a rotation story before its expiry arrives.
- **BirdNET processing**: analysis runs in the container app today
  (`internal/analysis`), which is why it needs `min_replicas = 1` and more CPU
  and memory than serving pages does. A Container Apps job is the natural next
  step: it would run the same queue over the same Cosmos documents, from the
  same image, and let the web app scale to zero again. That adds a job and the
  same identity-based roles, and a way to start it (a schedule, or an event when
  a card is received). The build downloads the models from Zenodo, so
  `az acr build` needs outbound network.
- **Abandoned partial uploads**: a card registered and never sent leaves blocks
  with no `audioFiles` document naming them, so neither retention nor a card
  delete finds them, and only the lifecycle rule's delete action eventually
  sweeps them. A job that cleans up after a card that has gone quiet would do
  it sooner, and would be the place to reclaim the card's reference too.
- **Email**: the upload flow promises "card received" and "results" emails,
  which needs Azure Communication Services or an external provider.

| 7 | Storage account (shared keys off) + `audio` container + lifecycle policy (the backstop, not the retention policy) | `azurerm_storage_account`, `azurerm_storage_container`, `azurerm_storage_management_policy` | `storage.tf` |
| 8 | Storage Blob Data Contributor → identity, and → whoever runs Terraform | `azurerm_role_assignment` ×2 | `storage.tf` |

| 10 | Log Analytics workspace | `azurerm_log_analytics_workspace` | `app.tf` |
| 11 | Container Apps environment | `azurerm_container_app_environment` | `app.tf` |
| 12 | Container app (env vars incl. `BIRDSENSE_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN` and `BIRDSENSE_AUDIO_RETENTION_DAYS`, three probes with every value set, exactly one replica, `depends_on` the role assignments) | `azurerm_container_app` | `app.tf` |
| 13 | Action group, mailing `alert_emails` | `azurerm_monitor_action_group` | `monitor.tf` |
| 14 | Five alert rules: replica restarts, 5xx, BirdNET unavailable, service health, resource health | `azurerm_monitor_metric_alert` ×2, `azurerm_monitor_scheduled_query_rules_alert_v2`, `azurerm_monitor_activity_log_alert` ×2 | `monitor.tf` |
| 15 | Monthly cost budget on the resource group | `azurerm_consumption_budget_resource_group` | `monitor.tf` |
| 16 | Custom domain, if one is configured: the hostname bound to the app. Its DNS records are made at our DNS host, and its certificate is Azure's managed one, bound by hand -- see [Custom domain](#custom-domain) | `azurerm_container_app_custom_domain` | `domain.tf` |

**Variables** (`variables.tf`): six are required and have no default --
`image_tag`, `bootstrap_admin`, `session_key`, `oidc_microsoft_client_id`,
`oidc_microsoft_client_secret` and `alert_emails` (see
[What is watched](#what-is-watched) for why that last one has no default).
Everything else has the default this file describes: `subscription_id` (null, so `ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` from the
environment), `public_url` (empty, so the container app's own hostname),
`custom_domain` (empty, so the app answers only on its own hostname),
`oidc_microsoft_tenant` (`common`), `env`, `location`, `name_suffix`, `cpu`,
`memory`, `perch_enabled`, `log_retention_days`, `audio_retention_days`, `audio_backstop_days`,
`budget_monthly_usd` and `grant_operator_blob_access`. A `staging` copy is a
second tfvars file with `env = "staging"`.

**Outputs** (`outputs.tf`): `app_url` and `app_fqdn`,
`custom_domain_verification_id` (the two a custom domain's DNS records are
built from), `acr_name` (which
`scripts/deploy.ps1` reads) and `acr_login_server`, `cosmos_endpoint`,
`blob_endpoint`, `identity_client_id`, `resource_group`, and `image_tag` --
what is deployed right now, so a settings change can be applied without a
rebuild.
