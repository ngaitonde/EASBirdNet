/**
 * <bs-upload-details> -- step 1. Four questions, none of which the volunteer
 * has to look up: the recorder is picked from the ones in the field, the date
 * defaults to today, and the notes are optional.
 *
 * The recorder is chosen, never guessed. A card carries nothing that says which
 * recorder wrote it, and a card filed against the wrong one is wrong about
 * where every detection on it was heard -- so the list starts on "choose a
 * recorder" and the step can't be finished until one is picked.
 *
 * Choosing the card happens at the end of this step rather than the start,
 * because the folder picker is the one moment a volunteer can get stuck, and
 * it's easier to recover from with the context already filled in.
 *
 * A volunteer lands here, so a card they left unfinished is offered above a new
 * one: an abandoned card is the thing that costs the program a season of audio.
 *
 * Finishing a card that is already on the server starts here too. Its station
 * and pull date are what make it that card, so they are shown rather than
 * asked, and the step is choosing the card again. Before the card is registered
 * again, the files the server already has are looked for in the chosen folder:
 * registering a different folder would take them off the card's list.
