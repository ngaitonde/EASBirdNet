// string, how that view is asked for, and the pages of it that have been
// fetched.
//
// <bs-detections> shows the list and <bs-detection-detail> steps through it,
// and neither survives a navigation -- the shell rewrites its shadow root, so
// both elements are built again for every route. What they share therefore
// lives here, in the module, which does survive.
//
// That is also what makes Previous and Next cheap. Stepping from one detection
// to the next is stepping through the page of rows the reviewer opened one
// from, which is already in hand; only running off the end of a page costs a
// request, and then only for the one page next door. Nothing re-runs the
// search.
//
// The pages held are a snapshot on purpose: a reviewer working through
// "unreviewed" would otherwise have the list shift under them with every
// verdict. Going back to the list fetches it again.
