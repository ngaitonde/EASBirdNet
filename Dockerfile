# own copy; bump the two together (CLAUDE.md, *Dependencies are scanned*).

# BirdNET runs from the `birdnet` Python package on LiteRT (no TensorFlow).
# Its wheels are built for glibc, which is why the runtime is Debian, not
# Alpine. Keep this Python version in step with analyzer/requirements.txt.
# Perch, the optional second model (BIRDSENSE_PERCH), only runs on TensorFlow,
# which requirements-perch.txt adds. It is always installed, so turning Perch
# on is a setting rather than a different image -- at ~1.3 GB of TensorFlow
# and ~400 MB of model on top of everything else (DEPLOYMENT.md).
